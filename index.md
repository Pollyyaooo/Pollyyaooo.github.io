Hi! I am currently a first-year [MSTI](https://gix.uw.edu/graduate/msti) student at [the University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).

I am currently exploring research in embodied and physical AI, with a particular focus on multimodal machine learning and sensing-based systems.

If you are interested in collaboration or discussing shared research directions, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:qinling3@uw.edu). 

I received my undergraduate training in [landscape planning](https://art.ecust.edu.cn/cpsj_14963/list.htm) at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/), where I developed a foundation in spatial thinking, environmental systems, and human–environment interaction.

At the graduate level, I have built an interdisciplinary background in connected devices, spanning hardware and software technologies, design practices, and business perspectives. 

You are welcome to view my [CV](assets/pdf/Polly_Yao_CV.pdf).
